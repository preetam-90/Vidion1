## Stack Auth Profile Image Troubleshooting Guide

Based on your screenshot showing "PR" initials instead of a profile image, here's how to diagnose and fix the issue:

### 1. Check Console Logs
Open your browser's Developer Tools (F12) and go to the Console tab. You should see debug logs like:
```
[UserProfile] user: {...}
[UserProfile] profileImageUrl: null (or some URL)
[UserProfile] displayName: Preetam
[UserProfile] primaryEmail: your-email@domain.com
[UserProfile] errored state: false
```

### 2. Upload Profile Image in Stack Auth
If `profileImageUrl` is `null` or `undefined`, you need to set a profile image:

1. Go to http://localhost:3000/handler/account-settings
2. Click on the "Profile image" section
3. Upload an image file
4. Save the changes
5. Refresh the main page to see if the avatar appears

### 3. Network Issues
If you have a `profileImageUrl` but the image isn't loading:

1. Open Network tab in Developer Tools
2. Filter by "Img" 
3. Look for requests to `content.stack-auth.com` or similar domains
4. Check if there are any failed requests (red status codes)
5. If blocked, check if ad blockers or browser security settings are interfering

### 4. Test the Image URL Directly
If you have a `profileImageUrl`:
1. Copy the URL from the console log
2. Paste it in a new browser tab
3. If it doesn't load, the issue is with the image file or URL

### 5. Alternative: Use Stack's Built-in UserButton
If custom implementation continues to have issues, you can use Stack's built-in component by uncommenting this line in the navbar:
```typescript
return <UserButton />; // <- Uncomment this line in UserProfile function
```

### 6. Clear Cache
Sometimes browser cache can cause issues:
1. Hard refresh with Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows/Linux) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
2. Clear browser cache for localhost:3000
3. Disable any service workers in Application tab

### 7. Check Environment
Make sure you're using the same Stack Auth project environment where you uploaded the profile image (dev vs production).

**Current Status**: Your navbar is correctly showing initials fallback ("PR"), which means:
✅ Stack Auth is working
✅ User is authenticated  
✅ Fallback logic is working
❌ Profile image is either not set or not loading

**Next Step**: Check the console logs and try uploading a profile image through the account settings page.
